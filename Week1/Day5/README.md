# Day 5 - Matrix Multiplication

## 2. Program Use
This program will generate two random sized and filled matrices.
The matrices will have dimensions between 1 and 5, and the contents will be between 1 and 9.
These two matrices are printed, and if they are compatable, then the dot product is applied between them and the resulting matrix is also printed.
